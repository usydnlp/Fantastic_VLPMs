# Fantastic VLPMs
This repository builds upon our recent [survey paper for **Vision-Language Pretraining Models (VLPMs)**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07356.pdf) pusblished in IJCAI 2022. It contains a list of papers (codes if available) and pretraining/downstream task datasets for the existing VLPMs, currently with main focus on *Text* and *Image*. We will keep maintaining and adding on new VLPM research and works. 

If you find any error or have any suggestion, please don't hesitate to open an issue and contact us.

# Introduction
So far, pretraining models have produced great success in both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. While CV researchers use VGG and ResNet predict the categorical label of a given image, BERT has been used and revolutionised many NLP tasks, such as natural language inference, and reading comprehension. Motivated by this, many cross-modal Vision-Language pretraining models, i.e., VLPMs, have been designed and trained by feeding visual and linguistic contents into the multi-layer transformer.

This repo builds on our survey and systematically organizes the existing VLPMs in terms of related papers (with their codes if available), and the commonly used pretraining and downstream task datasets, aiming to provide a general guideline and reference for future research development in VLPMs.
